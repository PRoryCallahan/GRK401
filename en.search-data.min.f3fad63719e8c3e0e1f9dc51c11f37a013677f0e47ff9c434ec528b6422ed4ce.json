This fell out of use. In the 8th century BC, the Phoenician alphabet was adopted to Greek, but there were also local variations. In 403/402 BC the Athenian archon Eucleides proposed the adoption of a standardized version of the Ionic alphabet. Other Greek communities adopted this in the decades that followed and the Euclidean alphabet is the standard Greek alphabet still in use today.\nSee the page on pronunciation for more detailed notes and exceptions, but a good rule of thumb for the Greek alphabet, as with any alphabet, is that the name of the letter often indicates the sound of the letter.\nUpper Case Lower Case Name Α α alpha Β β beta Γ γ gamma Δ δ delta Ε ε epsilon Ζ ζ zeta Η η eta Θ θ theta Ι ι iota Κ κ kappa Λ λ lambda Μ μ mu Ν ν nu Ξ ξ xi Ο ο omicron Π π pi Ρ ρ rho Σ σ / ς sigma Τ τ tau Υ υ upsilon Φ φ phi Χ χ chi Ψ ψ psi Ω ω omega A Note on Uppercase (Majuscule) \u0026amp; Lowercase # A Note on Sigma # In the 4th-3rd centuries BC, the typical form of sigma (Σ) whose straight lines worked well for inscriptions was modified for ease of writing with ink and paper. Rather than the 3 changes of direction required for (Σ), a lunate, or curved (like a crescent moon), form of sigma (Ϲ) evolved which better suited the medium.

As a language that existed over a wide area and over many centuries, there have been many dialects and varieties of pronunciation. We will review in class some of the chief variants in the pronunciation of Greek. Because it is a living language of prayer in some rites, you can and should learn the principals of pronunciation used in current practice. At the same time, because we are trying to recognize the spelling of words in texts that precede modern pronunciations, we will use a reconstructed pronunciation that better preserves the ability to distinguish the various vowels and diphthongs while making some concession to the accustomed vocal range of the native English speaker.\nThough we learning Greek, the Latin sī fuerīs Rōmae\u0026hellip; (\u0026ldquo;When in Rome\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;) is a good principal when it comes to your Greek pronunciation.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s take the word Κύριος (Kyrios, \u0026ldquo;Lord\u0026rdquo;).\nWhen in class, we will use the restored pronunciation that distinguishes Υυ [short French u as in lune] from long Ιῑ [like the French i in vive]. In this way, I can distinguish without the need for you to write on the board, etc. that you mean Κύριε not Κίριε.\nWhen in Mass, you would do well to adopt the modern pronunciation KEER-ee-ay (Kyrie) rather than shouting KOO-ri-eh.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/course-modules/chapter-1/","title":"Chapter 1","section":"Course Modules","content":" Chapter 1 # The Alphabet # Consonants # Vowels # Dipthongs # Subscripts # Breathings # Accents # Punctuation # Capitalization # "},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/prayers/","title":"Prayers","section":"Docs","content":" Prayers, Hymns, \u0026amp; Devotions # The following is a short guide to prayers, hymns, and devotions from the Greek tradition within the Church.\nSign of the Cross # εἰς τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Πατρὸς\nκαὶ τοῦ Υἱοῦ\nκαὶ τοῦ Ἀγίου Πνεύματος.\nSign of the Cross # In the name of the Father,\nand of the Son,\nand of the Holy Spirit.\nOur Father # Πάτερ ἡμῶν ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς\nἁγιασθήτω τό ὄνομά σου,\nἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου,\nγενηθήτω τὸ θέλημά σου,\nὡς ἐν οὐρανῷ καί ἐπί τῆς γῆς.\nΤόν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τόν ἐπιούσιον\nδός ἡμῖν σήμερον·\nκαί ἄφες ἡμῖν τά ὀφειλήματα ἡμῶν,\nὡς καί ἡμεῖς ἀφίεμεν τοῖς ὀφειλέταις ἡμῶν·\nκαί μή εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν,\nἀλλά ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ πoνηροῦ.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/syllabus/","title":"Syllabus","section":"Docs","content":" Textbook # Introduction to Classical \u0026amp; New Testament Greek: A Unified Approach by Michael Boler\nFall \u0026lsquo;22 - GRK 401: Introduction to Greek I # Essential Info\nInstructor: Patrick Callahan\nDay/Time: MWF 11:10am-12:00pm Room: 132 Office Hours: Friday 10:00-11:00am\nFull syllabus\nSpring \u0026lsquo;23 - GRK 402: Introduction to Greek II # Essential Info\nInstructor: Patrick Callahan\nDay/Time: TBA Room: TBA Office Hours: TBA\nFull syllabus\n"}]
